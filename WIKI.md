You will notice a few changes to recipes. all recipes are updated and will show in EMI if you search for them

Normally, after punching a tree you craft planks, then a crafting table. But you will realize my modpack removes not only planks, but every wood recipe from the crafting table and your crafting grid. Instead of getting planks, you get the crafting station, this crafting station is a full replcament of the vanilla crafting table

You will need this crafting station, along with 3 more logs and some gravel to craft the new woodcutter block. this is how you will be crafting anything wooden from now on, including tools to progress. 

please note, due to a limitation of the woodcutter, I cannot give more than one nonstackable item as an output. it costs 2 planks for one tool, so you would think that a log, which is worth 4 planks, would give 2 tools, i tried but the recipe became invalid. im sorry. just use the plank tool recipe, its cheaper, log is more expensive and i cannot fix it i am sorry

after you get stone, you will notice you cant crafts tone tools either! you need a stonecutter to craft stone tools, which has been made cheaper for progression. gravel instead of iron.

you will also notice, that all other tool recipes have been removed from the crafting grids, this is because they have all been remade using the smithing table! for any tool you want to craft, you need the wooden varient as a template, one stick, and the material of choice. for a full image gallery of the new smithing system, use EMI in game or go to HERE

the same has been done for all amors, but slightly differently. wood and stone armor has been added, and for any armor you want to craft, you need the wooden varient as a template, the material of choice, and instead of stick like from tools, ou need another peice of the material of choice, usually a nugget, but not all materials have nugget versions so use EMI or go to HERE

you will also note, that gold equipment is fully removed. this is because gold has incompatibility issues inside the smithing table, I couldnt get it to work, so its been replaced with copper (copper has very similar performance to the gold vanilla stuff)
