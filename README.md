Official dedicated server IP:
This server is run by me, it runs the Server Version of my modpack, so you only need the client version. the AIO version will work without issues also, just slower.

Unnoficial servers: none yet :<
These servers are not run by me, but they run my modpack so you can join with the client version. the aio will work without issues also, just slower.

# Issues?
If its a bug, especially related to crafting recipes, make an issue request here: 

The server and AIO versions are running my own datapack that changes and adds many recipes, so if one is broken I would not be suprised! Especially regarding the woodcutter custom recipes I added to add mod compatibility, there were SO MANY recipes I'm bound to have misstyped something and I haven't tested all of it. A github issue will bring it to my attention and fixed easiy and immediatly.

Also check out the wiki for help!

## AIO Version
Singleplayer version, has every mod and all configs in itself, so it can be used in offline worlds. Can still be used to join server with the server modpack without issues, there will just be massive amounts of unused redundancy that serves no purpose other than slow your client down. You can also use this AIO version to run a server but this is NOT recomended because all client sided mods will do nothing but slow down the server

## Client Version
Client version, has only client sided mods and mods required by both client and server. Be sure to join a server with the Server Version of the modpack or you will miss half the content! This is the intended way to use my modpack.
